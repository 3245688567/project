Update log: (guys when u update something, please write a log here):

13/12:

1. Chan Cho Kit
Update index.js -> index.jsx
I change a little bit on the UI, basically introduce a global var "login"=0. When login as an user, login=1. When login as an admin, login=2. It will affect the content on content and login page. 

2. Fong
   add sorting and searching function in index.jsx and server.js

3. Chan Cho Kit
   Add forms to "Content" for admin (login=2), buttons have no functions yet. Also the "Title" part for non-user (login=0) changes
